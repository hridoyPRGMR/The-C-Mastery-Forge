            This is arguably the most important use case for delegates in C#. Events are built on delegates. 
            When you click a button in a UI, the button doesn't know what code should runâ€”it just calls a delegate. 
            Your code "subscribes" to that event by providing a method to be called when the event occurs.
            C#
            // This is the delegate type for an event
            public event EventHandler MyEvent; 
            // ...later, when the event happens...
            MyEvent?.Invoke(this, EventArgs.Empty);
            The EventHandler is a delegate, and MyEvent is the event instance. Anyone can add their methods to this event using +=. */

            /* Asynchronous and Parallel Programming
            Modern C# uses delegates extensively for asynchronous operations. 
            Methods like Task.Run() take a delegate (often in the form of a lambda expression) to execute a piece of code on a separate thread.
            C#
            // Runs the code inside the lambda expression on a background thread
            Task.Run(() => {
                Console.WriteLine("This code is running in parallel!");
            });
            This allows your application to perform long-running tasks without freezing the user interface. */

            /*  LINQ and Lambda Expressions
             Delegates are the foundation of Language Integrated Query (LINQ). When you write a LINQ query like this:*/
            int[] numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];
            var evenNumbers = numbers.Where(n => n % 2 == 0);
            /*C#
            The Where method actually takes a delegate (Func<int, bool>) as a parameter. 
            The expression n => n % 2 == 0 is a lambda expression, which is essentially 
            a compact way of defining an anonymous method that can be assigned to a delegate.
